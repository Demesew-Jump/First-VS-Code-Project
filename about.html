                    <h2>Distribution</h2>
                    <p>Walia ibex live in the northern mountains of Ethiopia and are concentrated in the Semien Mountains.
                    They inhabit very steep, rocky cliff areas, mountain forests, subalpine grasslands, and scrub.</p>

                    <h2>Habits and Lifestyle</h2>
                    <p>Walia ibex are social animals. Outside of the mating season males live in bachelor groups and
                        females live in groups with their offspring. Walia ibex are very agile and hardy, able to climb on
                        bare rock and survive on sparse vegetation. They are most active in the morning and evening; during
                        the midday, they usually rest in the sun on rock ledges. When not resting they spend their time
                        grazing and may travel up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) per day in search of food. When foraging Walia
                        ibex also often stand on their hind legs to get to young shoots of giant heath. </p>

                    <p>Walia ibex are herbivores (graminivores, folivores). They feed on various grasses, leaves, herbs,
                    lichens, shrubs, and creepers.</p>

                     <h2>Mating Habits</h2>
                     <p>Walia ibex are polygynous meaning that males mate with more than one female. They usually breed from
                    March to May and during this time males compete for females by ramming their horns with amazing
                    force. After the gestation periods of 150-165 days females give birth to a single kid, or rarely
                    twins. They become reproductively mature at one year of age. </p>
