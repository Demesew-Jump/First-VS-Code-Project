                <p>
                    Walia ibex live in the northern mountains of Ethiopia and are concentrated in the Semien Mountains.
                    They inhabit very steep, rocky cliff areas, mountain forests, subalpine grasslands, and scrub.

             <h2>Habits and Lifestyle</h2>
                <p>
                    Walia ibex are social animals. Outside of the mating season males live in bachelor groups and
                    females live in groups with their offspring. Walia ibex are very agile and hardy, able to climb on
                    bare rock and survive on sparse vegetation. They are most active in the morning and evening; during
                    the midday, they usually rest in the sun on rock ledges. When not resting they spend their time
                    grazing and may travel up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) per day in search of food. When foraging Walia
                    ibex also often stand on their hind legs to get to young shoots of giant heath.
